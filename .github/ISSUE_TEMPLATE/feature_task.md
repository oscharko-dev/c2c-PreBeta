Parent Epic: #<epic_number>

## Purpose

Describe the goal of this issue and the user, developer, platform, or governance outcome it must create.

## Agent Execution Mode

- [ ] Single-agent
- [ ] Agent team
- [ ] Audit-only
- [ ] Refactor-only
- [ ] Feature delivery
- [ ] Audit/verification-heavy
- [ ] Human-led / agent-assisted

## Agent Routing Hints

- Lead agent: `coordinator | developer | architect | pr-shepherd`.
- Suggested specialist agents: `explorer | implementor | test-engineer | security-reviewer | performance-engineer | a11y-auditor | docs-editor | docs-writer | verifier | pr-reviewer | pr-shepherd`.
- Primary area label: `area:...`.
- Expected write ownership: list files/modules that may be edited, or say `TBD by coordinator`.

## Expected Verification

- [ ] Required GitHub check: `ci`.
- [ ] Studio browser quality gate when Studio UI or BFF browser behavior changes.
- [ ] Studio performance and memory gates when editor performance, Monaco, rendering, or large-output behavior changes.
- [ ] Studio visual regression when visible UI structure changes.
- [ ] Markdown link check when documentation changes.
- [ ] W0.2 release gate when W0.2 product-path semantics change.
- [ ] W0.3 release gate when W0.3 workflow or Studio hardening semantics change.
- [ ] Security review when trust boundaries, auth/session, secrets, CSP, model access, execution, patch application, or external calls change.
- [ ] Qodana/static-analysis review when security-sensitive or shared control-plane code changes.

## Review Settlement and Formal Issue Completion

- [ ] The implementation PR waits for required GitHub checks and expected automated GitHub Copilot/Codex reviews before merge.
- [ ] All actionable review findings are fixed or explicitly dispositioned in the PR before merge.
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria and Expected Verification checkboxes are updated only when evidence exists.
- [ ] Required documentation, PR evidence, issue comments, migration notes, screenshots, logs, or follow-up issues are completed when requested by this issue.
- [ ] The issue remains open until implementation is merged, review findings are settled, and closure evidence is recorded.

## Stop Conditions

- [ ] Stop if the implementation would expand beyond this issue's stated scope.
- [ ] Stop if required acceptance criteria are missing, contradictory, or no longer match the linked epic.
- [ ] Stop if the work requires secrets, customer data, private runtime logs, or token-bearing artifacts.
- [ ] Stop if two parallel agents would need to edit the same file scope.
- [ ] Stop if the change would weaken architecture boundaries, quality gates, security posture, evidence semantics, deterministic verification, or required `ci` guarantees.
- [ ] Stop after three CI or review-finding repair attempts with different root causes and report the blocker.

## Language and Professional Standard

- All issue work, PR descriptions, code comments, configuration properties, schema fields, README updates, Markdown files, and GitHub comments must be written in professional English.
- Use accurate enterprise product terminology; when limitations exist, state them precisely without prototype-only, placeholder, fake, or informal framing.
- Build production-ready, state-of-the-art solutions while keeping implementation simple, maintainable, and focused on the issue scope.
- Be creative and innovative where it improves product quality, but avoid unnecessary special cases, speculative abstractions, and process overhead.

## Scope

Clearly define what is in scope. Remember: no implementation happens without an issue.

## Out of Scope

List items that are explicitly not part of this issue. Use follow-up issues for deferred scope.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criteria 1
- [ ] Criteria 2

## Engineering Notes

Add specific constraints, architectural notes, related ADRs, or known implementation risks.
